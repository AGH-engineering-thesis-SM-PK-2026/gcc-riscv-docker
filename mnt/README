BASIC C COMPILATION

First compile your C file/s with main function:

rvcc iotest.c iotest.elf

Get memory-file-ready executable dump:

rvdump iotest.elf

What does the program do?

Boot code starts:

- sets up stack pointer register (sp/x2) to point to MEMEND (00002000);
- calls main function.

Your main function will then execute its code. After that it returns
control to boot code again which doesn't do much else: loops forever.

Why .elf extension?

Mostly for gitignore purposes.
